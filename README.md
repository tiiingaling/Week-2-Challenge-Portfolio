# Week-2-Challenge-Portfolio


## Description
This week's challenge was to build a portfolio page from scratch using HTML and CSS elements. I had initially a lot of trouble with the flexbox element which took up a lot of time but I have managed to fulfill most/all of the acceptance criteria although it does not visually look very good. I plan to come back to this project.

As I do not have anything to showcase at the moment the portfolio contains placeholder links and images to websites with titles below them. I have a nav bar which directs to the specific parts of the page and also a contact me section with my photo and links to my linkedin and github!
